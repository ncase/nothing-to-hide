###What's all this about, then?

Nothing To Hide is an "anti-stealth" game where you are forced to help in your own surveillance.
The puzzles are challenging but fair, with depth in a deceptively simple mechanic, similar to games such as Braid and Portal.
It's a story of a teenage girl riddled with insecurity in a world obsessed with security.
She's never had a private thought. If you can't hide who you are... you have to hide who you *really* are.
